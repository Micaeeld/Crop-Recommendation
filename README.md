The specific dataset used in this project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aksahaha/crop-recommendation.

## Context
Agriculture is one of the main metabolic activities in many countries. The use of technology and data analysis can help improve productivity and efficiency in agriculture.

## Dataset
The "Crop Recommendation Dataset" dataset contains information about growing different types of crops such as corn, soybeans, rice, etc. It contains information about soil type, climate, moisture, pH levels and nutrients.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository on your computer.
2. Open the `Crop Recommendation.ipynb` notebook in a Python development environment such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Collaboratory.
3. Run the notebook cells in order, following the analysis and generated graphs.

## Results
Based on the insights gained from the exploratory analysis of the data, I recommended the most suitable crops for each soil type and climate.
The results of this booklet can help farmers and agricultural experts to identify the best crops to grow in different regions, considering soil and climate characteristics.
